# Custom Neural Network Implementation
This is a custom implementation of a neural network in JavaScript with no external dependencies.<br/>
The goal of this project is to understand the inner workings of a neural network and to implement it from scratch.<br/>
The neural network currently is trained and tested custom generated data of numbers 0 to 9.<br/>

## Future Goals
1. Optimize the code for better performance.
2. Implement a more complex dataset such as the MNIST dataset.
3. Try regression problems.
